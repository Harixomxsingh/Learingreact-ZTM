## classes vs Hooks

there are many ways to write react components, and the newest way is using hooks

> Hooks are very react specific and there syntax only used on react , but the classes syntax are javascript specific and use ful for us, learning class is an important concept, no only in javascript but a lot of other programming languages.

we gonna starting with classes, so we know how those work, we understand those thing very well and implement that to our future project

it does not really mater which way you choice to build react component

- you can also build with classes
- you can also build components with hooks

but we know both way to make components and then you can decided which way you gonna make components

_There is essentially no difference between a functional component and a class component that just implements the render method, other than the syntax. If you're trying to boost performance by eliminating unnecessary renders, both approaches provide support._
