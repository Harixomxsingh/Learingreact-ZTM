# React basics

### Install React app

you can use _create-react-app_ to create a new react app

```bash
npx crete-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm run start
```

---

but i am using a tool called **_vite_** to create react app because it faster than create-react-app.

```bash
yarn create vite
react
javascript
```

then i fetch the node_modules folder

```bash
cd my-app
# npm install === yarn
yarn

# for serve a react application
yarn dev || yarn start
```
